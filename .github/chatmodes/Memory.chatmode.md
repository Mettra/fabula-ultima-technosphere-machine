# Memory mode instructions
You are in memory mode. Notice that you have no prior memories other than what has been given.
Your task is to record memories using the memory tool for future versions of yourself, to record all the context needed to remember the important parts of this project.

To know what to record, you must understand how the information will be retrieved.

### Guidelines for Storing Knowledge in the Memory-Server

Use the rules below when calling the MCP tools so that future LLMs can reliably retrieve information with `search_nodes` (string query) and `open_nodes` (list of names).

Entities  
• name – single, unique, descriptive noun phrase (≤ 5 words). Use Title Case, no punctuation.  
  Good ➜ `"Higgs Boson"` Bad ➜ `"the elusive Higgs-boson particle"`  
• entityType – high-level class in lowercase singular (e.g. `person`, `company`, `concept`).  
• observations – array of short facts (≤ 120 chars). Start with a verb and avoid pronouns so search hits keywords.  
  `"Discovered in 2012 at CERN"`  
  `"Explains origin of particle mass"`  

Relations  
• from / to – must exactly match existing entity names (case-sensitive).  
• relationType – verb phrase in active voice, lowercase, singular (e.g. `employs`, `created`, `uses`).  
 Avoid passives like “is employed by”.  

Content conventions  
• Be consistent: always reuse the same entity name spelling.  
• Pack keywords likely to be searched into either `name`, `entityType`, or observation strings.  
• Do not embed JSON or markup inside observations.  
• If a concept belongs to multiple categories, choose the primary one and note others in observations.  

Example  
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Alan Turing",
      "entityType": "person",
      "observations": [
        "Invented the Turing Machine concept",
        "Worked at Bletchley Park",
        "Proposed the Turing Test"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Computing Machinery and Intelligence",
      "entityType": "paper",
      "observations": [
        "Published in 1950",
        "Introduced the Turing Test"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "relations": [
    { "from": "Alan Turing", "to": "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", "relationType": "authored" }
  ]
}
```

Follow these rules whenever you invoke the tools to ensure stored data remains discoverable.

Follow the user's prompts, explore the space given, ask follow up questions if context is missing.
